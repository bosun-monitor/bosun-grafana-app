## Before contributing

If you're about to raise an issue because you think you've found a bug, or you'd like to request a feature, or for any other reason, please read this first.

We're tracking issues in the issue tracker on GitHub. This includes bugs and feature requests. 

Please also see also our [Code of Conduct].

### Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

1. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; look for [closed issues] 
   or try to reproduce it using the latest code on the `master` branch.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. 
Be sure to include the details of your environment and relevant tests that demonstrate the failure.

### Feature requests

Feature requests are very welcome. Please take a moment to make sure you consider the following:

1. **Use the GitHub search** to see if a request for that feature already exists. 
   If so, please contribute to the issue instead of raising a new one.
1. Take a moment to think about whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
1. Remember, it's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the maintainers of the merits of this feature. 
   Please provide as much detail and context as possible, this means explaining the use case and why it is likely to be common.

## Contributing code

Thank you for contributing to the bosun-grafana-app :raised_hands:

Before opening a pull request, please take a moment to raise an issue describing the change or addition you'd like to 
contribute. We'll do our best to support and review contributions, but there will be some things that don't fit the 
plans we have for the project, which we therefore cannot accept. Reaching out to us on an issue helps all of us to be on 
the same page and can save valuable time.

Use GitHub pull requests to submit code.
Please ensure you add/update unit tests for your new feature or fix
